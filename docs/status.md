## Summary of the Project:

Our project will aim to train an agent to complete a challenge map in the least amount of time. The challenge maps will consist of fire blocks and traps, and platforming that the agent will be trained to navigate and go through fire if needed. In particular, we are interested in reducing the completion time of the challenge map relative to the expected completion time of a normal player. The input for our agent will consist of the block type, enemy, and obstacles on the map. The output will be the chosen movement of the agent. We will aim for the agent to take the shortest possible route during the challenge run using Q-learning and Deep Q-learning to gradually learn an optimal policy.

## Approach



## Evaluation



## Remaining Goals and Challenges

- As of now, the agentâ€™s performance has not been tested with the maps with more obstacles such as traps. 
- Also, the agent has only four moves (move north, move south, move east, and move west), but ideally, the agent should be able to learn jump obstacles.
